# WSB vs. Markets

## Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to analyse comment data from r/wallstreetbets, and examine trends in hype and sentiment, and compare it to real share market performance.
In particular, I want to see determine the causative direction between stocks being "hyped" in online forum and their increases value.
It is intuitive that it could be in either direction - ie: forum activity could cause price increase, or price increase could increase forum activity.
However the former has a potential use case in predicting and directing investment decision.

This is a self-education project driven by my own curiosity in market behaviour, and my professional development goals in data science. 
I won't be investing any of my own money based on the findings of this analysis, and I wouldnt recommend others do so either.
